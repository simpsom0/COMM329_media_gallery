## Project Scenario
Your new client is asking for an interactive web page
to display a collection of photos and text, both as
thumbnails and at full size. **Using HTML, CSS, and
JS, design and build a media gallery with an
image slider, image lightboxes, and a mobile
navigation menu that looks great at both large
and small screen sizes.**

> *You’ll assemble a collection of approximately sixteen
images, plus a title and a few lines of text for each. The
images can come from anywhere, but you may need to
process them and write text for them. If they fit a
theme, that’s probably for the best.*

## Requirements
  - [ ] Flex-box and grid for macro-level layout.
  - [ ] Javascript for mobile nav, slider animation, and lightbox modals.
  - [ ] Semantic HTML elements (i.e. <nav>, <article>, etc.)
  - [ ] Media queries for display at different screen sizes.
  - [ ] Clear images and snappy microcopy.
  - [x] Good color and typography.
  - [ ] Icons and hover effects on buttons.
  - [ ] Animations and transitions.
  - [ ] A grid, either regular or masonry-style.
  - [ ] Navigation to several fake pages.
  - [ ] Copyright and credits in the footer.
  - [x] Color variables in the CSS.
